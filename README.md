# reveal_setup.py

Simple python-based setup script to create a directory, git clone the reveal.js
repo into it, remove unneccessary files so as to make the presentation directory
as portable and clean as possible and install a barebones `index.html` file with
scripts useful in scientific presentations enabled.
